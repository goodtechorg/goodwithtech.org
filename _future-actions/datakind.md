Not only did I get to meet these awesome data do-gooders and expand my network, but I also got to use my data science skills, share what I knew with the team, and in return, learn how to collaborate on volunteer projects and juggle the day job and after-hours volunteer work with flair!"

"I’ve volunteered for them and want to do so again. Met great people during my project."

"You should just email a coordinator. They're pretty friendly! They do have a high standard mainly because they don't want people to drop out partway through a project... I don't think there will be issues with self-learning but ideally, you would want to show them what you have done in the past."

"The first meetup (DataDive) I attended was a 2-day event. There were around 30–40 volunteers who came together for this event. There were people who were new and wanted to learn, and there were others who were leading data scientists in their fields. The meetup started with an introduction of the various projects associated with different NGOs"... "It is good to have some experience in this field to contribute to DataKind. If you don’t possess the required skills, you can start working on them. There are plenty of online courses for the same. I highly recommend The Analytics Edge to start with. DataKind also holds regular events with the aim of educating the Data Science community through a series of events called DataLearn. "
