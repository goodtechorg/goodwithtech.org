title: "Getting started with #techforgood - what I've found so far"
---
<p>I first started exploring ways to do more good with technology last summer having left my role as CTO at FundApps. At the time, I found it hard to know where to start, especially when it came to finding concrete actions I could take. I've learnt a lot since then, so wanted to share some of the amazing organisations out there that *can* enable you to take action - big or small - if you're so inclined.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The links I include in the post are just as a result of my personal exploration and far from exhaustive. I'd love to hear from you if there are others I should know about!</p>

<p>I started by just trying to find where all the people interested in doing good with tech were hanging out! Aside from stalking the #techforgood hashtag, I was introduced to some great communities.</p>

<h3>Online:</h3>

<h2>Contributing code</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As software engineers, we use many amazing open source projects day in day out - so contributing to those you care about is a fairly obvious first port of call. <a href="https://opensourcefriday.com">OpenSourceFriday</a> is a great way to get started. That said, I wanted to focus my efforts on broader 'social good', and so the rest of what I share here are with that goal in mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A member of the team at FundApps was a long-term volunteer with <a href="http://www.datakind.org">DataKind</a> who work on giving specific insights for charities from their data. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Outside the data science space, <a href="https://socialcoder.org/">SocialCoder</a> connects volunteer programmers with UK charities for specific, goal-oriented projects. <a href="http://radicalengineers.com">RadicalEngineers</a>&nbsp;connect organisations  with a growing community of software developers and designers, and also <a href="http://radicalengineers.com/meetups.html">meet up regularly</a> in London. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are also several other non-UK organisations such as <a href="https://www.catchafire.org/volunteer/?init=1&amp;page=1&amp;skill_filter=34">CatchaFire</a>, doing skills-based volunteer matching, and organisations like <a href="https://www.donatecode.com">DonateCode</a> and <a href="https://benetech.org/get-involved/volunteer/">Benetech</a> that are worth a look if you'd like to find coding projects.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would love to hear your experiences if you volunteer with any of these organisations, or if you know of others I haven't mentioned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h3>A note of caution</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you do end up contributing to software doing good, amazing! I'd just share two few points - perhaps obvious - that I personally found helpful to keep in mind:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>ensure you talk directly to and understand the needs of your end users - as you would in any product development effort.</li><li>think carefully about the long term sustainability of the project once the volunteer engineers have departed - both operationally, and with respect to future product development (if any)</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have seen several well intentioned projects fall flat when the points above had not been given enough thought. Long-term sustainability is one reason many organisations such as DataKind work with specific project goals in mind - finding answers to specific questions from data, as opposed to building technology that the organisation then has to support and maintain. Good luck!</p>

<p>If you're interested in teaching, there are many options to volunteer:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.codeclubworld.org/">Code Club</a>&nbsp;is a worldwide network of free volunteer-led coding clubs for children aged 9-13. &nbsp;There are 13,000 in 150 countries, including 7,000 in the UK.</li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">At FundApps, the engineering team hosted a </span><a style="font-size: 1rem;" href="/actions/codefirstgirls">CodeFirst: Girls</a><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> course over 8 weeks.

<h2>Mentoring</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have a little more experience, organisations such as <a href="https://bethnalgreenventures.com">Bethnal Green Ventures</a>, <a href="http://zinc.vc">Zinc.vc</a> and <a href="http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com">Charity Entrepreneurship</a> have regular intakes of social enterprise start-ups, and are often looking for experienced mentors to support them.</p>

<h2>If you're a founder or exec...</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you're a founder or senior exec at a technology business, I'd strongly recommend you investigate becoming a B Corporation. Certifying as a <a href="https://bcorporation.net/">B Corporation</a> enshrines the need to consider the interests not only of shareholders, but all stakeholders - notably employees, customers and the wider community. So far more than 3,000 companies globally have become B Corps, and there is growing momentum, with 30 American business leaders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/25/us-companies-tell-apple-and-amazon-to-put-planet-before-profits">championing a more ethical way of doing business</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At FundApps it gave us a framework within which to <a href="https://www.fundapps.co/blog/b-corp-best-for-the-world">focus our future efforts</a> and aligned with efforts we were already making introducing policies like <a href="https://www.jamescrowley.net/2018/08/14/replacing-maternity-paternity-with-parental-leave/">fair paternity leave</a>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a personal capacity, I'd also encourage you to check out <a href="https://www.jamescrowley.net/2019/01/06/taking-the-founders-pledge/">Founders Pledge</a>, making a legal commitment to donate a % of any future proceeds from your shareholdings in a start-up business. </p>
