I wanted to do more good with the tech skills I had, but I didn't really know where to start. I'm still new to the #techforgood space but for me the most useful discoveries have been hearing about others experiences, and finding actual concrete steps that I could take. This is my way of sharing what I find - hopefully it's useful to someone else out there in a similar journey, and I'd love for others to <a href="/contribute">share their own</a> too.
