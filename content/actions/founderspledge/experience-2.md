I, and many founders I know, have uttered that promise to embark on philanthropy in a meaningful way if and when we can. But we’re yet to be tested on whether or not we can live up to our avowed ideals. And, let’s be honest — we’re human, and humans have an unfortunate tendency to get distracted by fast cars and shiny gadgets.

The Founders Pledge is a way of holding ourselves to that promise — of ensuring we don’t get distracted. And, as such, it has the potential to ensure more philanthropic intentions come to fruition.
