Andy and I made a simple pledge; as founders, we would commit to give at least 2% of any future proceeds from our companies - for example, from a sale or stock market flotation - to social causes of our choosing. So although we couldn't give now, we would when we could.

So... so what? Two people promising to give money they haven't made yet towards good causes. Not going to stop world hunger, is it? Perhaps not. But what we did also do is tell other founders in the tech sector about our promise. And they liked the idea, and they said they'd do it too - and they told their friends as well. Two years on, and the Founders Pledge has properly taken off.
