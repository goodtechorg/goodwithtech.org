When my co-founder Andrew introduced me to Founders Pledge, the concept totally clicked for me. I could turn my vague plan into a legally binding personal commitment in a matter of minutes. Even better, when the time (hopefully!) comes to donate theyâ€™d help me figure out the most effective charities to support the causes I care about.
