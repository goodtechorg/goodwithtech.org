CodeFirst: Girls is a social enterprise that directly helps women to overcome one of the single biggest barriers to entering the tech industry - education.
​
We want to change society and the face of the UK economy by teaching 20,000 women how to code for free by the end of 2020.
In 2018, female Programmers and software developer made up only 4.2% of tech and telco professionals in the UK. That number was down from 10% in 2007.

​Over the past 5 years we’ve taught 10,000+ women how to code for free. We’ve delivered £6.75 million worth of free coding education
