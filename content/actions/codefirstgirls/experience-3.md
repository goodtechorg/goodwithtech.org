Back in June I was fortunate enough to attend The Lead Developer Conference here in London. Amongst many great talks was one given by Beverley Newing about how to run awesome tech internships. Part of this was focused on the challenges of getting into technology for those coming from non-university routes and the importance of internships and courses enabling people to do so. I walked away feeling that this was certainly something I was in a position to do something about.

Getting back into the office later that week I immediately set to getting in touch with a few organisations and people to try and find out what would be most useful and a good fit for our company. After a bit of searching around we signed up to host the CF:G introduction to web development course during their autumn session.

A few logistical hoops later (figuring out how to seat everyone around a screen for the content with space and power for laptops was probably the trickiest part of the entire process!) and we were ready to start. CF:G provided the course materials, slides and scripts for us to work from and on a dark, wet Monday night in mid-October 22 young women descended on the FundApps office to start their journey into development!
