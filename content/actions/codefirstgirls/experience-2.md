This course proved to me that there is space, not just for women in this industry, but for women from all different educational backgrounds â€“ be it an English Literature student, or a woman with a more conventional path to coding, such as an engineering degree. This is because of the career talks from experts from different parts of the industry and through conversations with the course instructors about their own career paths. In fact, judging by the different strengths of the various projects by other groups in this CF:G Summer Intensive alone, this diversity serves different markets, creates different solutions, and can only improve the industry.
