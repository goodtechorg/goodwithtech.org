Police Rewired are a community of volunteer professionals with an interest in policing technology, community safety, and fighting crime.

We build tools to make people safer.

We support and engage our members through a series of projects, hackathons, workshops and meet-ups. All our projects are open source and volunteer-led.

We connect independent developers with policing organisations, front-line policing staff, community groups, and partners with interests aligned with ours to help develop world class solutions.
