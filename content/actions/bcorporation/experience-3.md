Back in April 2018 we released a blog post sharing our ambition and commitment to becoming a certified B Corp. The B Corp mission has always resonated strongly with us and much of how we operate FundApps is about becoming the ‘force for good’ that is shared by the B Corp community.

The journey to being a force for good doesn’t stop with our B Corp certification. We have many areas we can improve in, from our turnover rate as we grow, to building upon our benefits offering, and to raising the bar on our environmental performance when we move into our new London office.
