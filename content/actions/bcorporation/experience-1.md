Certifying as a B Corps means that your company considers its impact on all stakeholders (employees, clients, production companies, local communities and the environment) not just shareholders or profit. I emphasise ‘not just’. B Corporation is not anti-shareholder value or anti-profit. It simply challenges the concept that business is only there for profit alone. At the heart of B Corps is the concept of ‘interdependence’. In other words, we are responsible to one another and the planet to create the right kind of progress.
