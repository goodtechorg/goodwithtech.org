Open source is made by people just like you. [This Friday, invest a few hours contributing to the software you use and love.](https://opensourcefriday.com)

Contributing to open source happens at all levels, across projects and design, documentation, operations and code. You donâ€™t need to overthink what exactly your first contribution will be, or how it will look.
