Last year, I volunteered for Devoxx4Kids London and it was lots of fun. I like IT and I like kids, so it’s a good motivation! Playing with Scratch, making Nao the robot dance & talk, programming some Lego Mindstorms for battles, etc. You almost end up being a kid yourself!

It’s a very good initiative to introduce basic engineering and programming skills to the youngest generation so they discover what IT is in a good and practical way. This experience can also teach them some soft skills like patience, sharing and listening.
