[Devoxx4Kids](http://www.devoxx4kids.org) is an international NGO that aims to:

* Teach children Computer Programming while having fun and introduce them to concepts of robotics, electronics and generally being creative with these kind of devices.
* Inspire not only children but also the classical education system, so they too can start including computer science in their curriculum.
* Demystify programming for girls and introduce them to computer science in order to improve gender equality in that field.
